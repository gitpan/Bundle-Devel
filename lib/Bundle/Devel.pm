=head1 NAME

Bundle::Devel - A bundle to install the main set of Devel:: modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Devel'>

=head1 CONTENTS

Devel::DProf    - Profiling tool

Devel::Cover    - Currently the prefered coverage tool

Devel::Coverage - Newer, but somewhat imature coverage tool

That's the basics for me, but if you want something added, just let
me know, or better file a bug against the package.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Let's just say I'm sick of installing the Devel:: modules on at a time.
This bundle installs most of the common Devel:: modules in one go.
