NAME
    Bundle::Devel - A bundle to install the main set of Devel:: modules

SYNOPSIS
    "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Devel'"

CONTENTS
    Devel::DProf - Profiling tool

    Devel::Cover - Currently the prefered coverage tool

    Devel::Coverage - Newer, but somewhat imature coverage tool

    That's the basics for me, but if you want something added, just let me
    know, or better file a bug against the package.

DESCRIPTION
    Let's just say I'm sick of installing the Devel:: modules on at a time.
    This bundle installs most of the common Devel:: modules in one go.

SUPPORT
    For general comments, contact the author.
